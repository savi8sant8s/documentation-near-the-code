# Documentation near code

[Versão em Português](pt-br.md)

<br>

<strong>I encourage and venture to follow the following principles:</strong>

- The code is more important than the documentation, but with time you will forget part of what you coded. So document from the beginning to get a high-level view of what you've done.

- The code is more important than the documentation, but having the documentation will help anyone joining the project in the future. This will avoid the bus factor.

- Using a specific documentation tool is cool, but if it's too far from the code, you might forget to update the documentation. So, bring the documentation as close to the code as possible.

Let's look for better ways to integrate code with documentation. Working software is important, but we still need documentation.

- Swagger (https://swagger.io);
